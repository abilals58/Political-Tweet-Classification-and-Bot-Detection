# Political-Tweet-Classification-and-Bot-Detection
This repository contains Political Tweet Classification and Bot detection project that is an ML and feature extraction based project to inspect tweets and users metadata and detect whether a tweet is political or not as well as detect whether a user is bot or not. Project has 3 parts which are feature extraction, tweet classification, and bot classification. The main purpose is to give a possibility range for any users (isBot) or tweets (isPolitical) between [0,1] and to minimize mean square error when those predictions compared to the real labels. Project has 3 steps, at each step the MSE values are decreased to optimize the predictors.

Some feture extraction, and training data are here:
